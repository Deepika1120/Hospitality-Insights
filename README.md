##About This Project:

##Challenge: Provide Insights to revenue team in hospitality domain.Built a dashboard in Power BI to analyze three months sales data of different AtliQ hotels across four different cities.

##Things learnt during this journey:

1. Cleaning Data
2. Creating measures and calculated columns
3. Usage of charts in the specific scenarios
4. Power of using custom tooltips
5. Telling stories and insights after data analysis
6. Usage of slicers to narrow down the requirements.

##Problem statement:

Atliq owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.
